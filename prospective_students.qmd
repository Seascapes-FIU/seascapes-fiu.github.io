  <h1>Opportunities in Our Lab</h1>
  <h2>Prospective Graduate Students</h2>
  <p>Dr. Santos advises students through the <a href="https://case.fiu.edu/biology/">Department of Biological Science’s</a> graduate program. Our department offers an MS and a PhD program in Biology. The deadline to apply for Fall is December 1. I am quite selective about the people joining our lab, but am interested in taking students who are passionate about ecology, have a nagging curiosity about nature, are hardworking and are serious about scientific inquiry and graduate school. Graduate school is not necessarily for everyone…. In order to succeed in graduate school you really need to want it! <b> Please note that I am not taking graduate students for the fall of 2025, however if you feel you are a strong fit for the lab, please still reach out with the below information.</b></p>

  <p>If you are interested in working in my laboratory as a graduate student, please review our lab's website and familiarize yourself with our current projects and recent publications. You should also review the application guidelines from the biology graduate programs first, and contact me before applying. Please email me a copy of your resume or CV, an unofficial copy of your undergraduate and/or graduate transcript (if you have an MS), and a statement of your research interests, why you want to go to graduate school, and why you think our lab is a good match. Prospective students should have some prior research experience and preferably with marine fieldwork.</p>
  
  <h2>Prospective Undergraduate interns and technicians</h2>
