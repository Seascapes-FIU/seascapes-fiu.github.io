    "text": "Dr. Rolando Santos\n  Email: rsantos@fiu.edu\n  \n  I am a marine spatial ecologist, focusing my research on the restoration and resilience of marine habitats and faunal responses to multi-scale habitat characteristics. Research interests center on the application of landscape ecology concepts in marine/aquatic ecosystems to study the influence of spatial structure and habitat heterogeneity on the patterning of marine communities, and species interactions, distribution, and movement. I oversee a variety of projects that use a combination of modelling and quantitative methods to further understand how seascape dynamics influence species distributions\n  I was born and spent the first two decades of my life in Puerto Rico, I attended the University of Puerto Rico at Río Piedras for my dual bachelors in Environmental Science and Geography. Afterwards, I moved to Miami to start environmental contracting, and eventaully started my Masters at Nova Southeastern University. Upon completion of my Masters, I was contacted by Dr. Deigo Lirman from the University of Miami, where I successfully completed my PhD in biology. Afterwards, I was a postdoc in Dr. Jennifer Rehage's lab at Florida International University before transitioning to an assistant professor and starting my own lab. I have strong ties with University of Puerto Rico's Biology Department (go cocks!) as well as the Sociedad Ambiente Marino, a nonprofit working in coral restoration in the Northeast Marine Sanctuary.\n  My research interests takes me to many unique ecosystems, both marine and aquatic. I am interested in using and developing new remote sensing techniques to further improve our understanding and mapping of marine environments, so that further questions of organism movement may be understood. In particular, I have worked in seagrass communities, utilizing drone and satellite data to understand habitat suitability of seagrass and associated juvenile fish movement. I also have worked heavily with Dr. Lirman's Rescue a Reef inititave, which focuses on innovative restoration techniques to outplant coral back  to Florida's Reef Tract. I also am involved with the Luquillo Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in El Yunque National Forest, Puerto Rico. I am co-PI on a long-term project studying shrimp movement response to seasonal rainfall dynamics in mountain step-pools.

I have a love for nature and especially the water, so you can always find me nearby."

This conference was a great honor, we are happy to have such great representation from the SELab as well as our sister lab, the Coastal Fish Ecology & Fisheries Lab. We heard great talks from our lab members, including:\n\nGina Badlowski: “Mesoconsumer trophic linkages across reef-seagrass seascapes within Sanctuary Preservation Areas in the Florida Keys”\nMarianna Coppola: “Addressing seagrass seascape multiscale responses to water quality in a subtropical estuarine lagoon”\nDr. James: “Hypervolume modelling: a multivariate tool for seagrass ecosystem assessments”\nDr. Rodemann: “Development of an upscaled submerged aquatic vegetation leaf cover model for long-term time series analysis in Florida Bay”\nDr. Rehage: “Identifying critical thresholds and effects of land-based pollution from nutrients and pharmaceuticals on seagrass habitats and fauna”\n\nGreat job to all presenters, we are happy to have your representation at such a prestigious conference internationally!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an effort to continue ground truthing for the FISHSCAPE project, Marianna Coppola partnered with the International Seakeepers Society to be matched with yacht owners wanting to help scientists get out in the field. She completed valuable work for her remote sensing project affiliated with FISHSCAPE, many thanks to Captain and crew aboard the DISCOVER Yacht Amelia Dawn II!\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease help us in congratulating Gina on her wonderful accomplishment of winning the FCE LTER all scientists meeting “Best Student Poster” award! We are proud of her dedication to her work and showcasing her research at the conference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2024 Benthic Ecology Meeting sponsored Valentina Bautista and Nico Rivas for their talks, including lodging and a transportation stipend. We are honored that two of our lab’s members were selected for this award.\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA congratulations are in order for Nico Rivas, who successfully defended his project proposal, titled “Assessing the Dynamic State of Caribbean Coral Reefs: The Influence of Seascape Properties, Macroalgae and Herbivory on Coral Population Growth and Community Assembly.” Now, Nico is a PhD candidate and will spend the rest of his graduate career focused on analyzing data and writing his dissertation. Well done, Nico, for a great defense and passing this grad school milestone!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam Seascape took over team FISHSCAPE for an outreach event at Citrus Grove K-8 two weeks ago! Lab members Hannah-Marie, Gina, and Nico spent a night teaching k-8 students and parents about some of the science the lab (and collaborators) do for an ongoing project down in the Florida Keys:\nFish In Seagrass Habitats: Seascape Connectivity Across Protected Areas\nStudents had a blast learning how to measure a Great Barracuda, one of the main study species! Students also got to learn about stable isotopes: how to process samples using sweet tarts and fruit roll ups, drop their sample into an analyzer, and finally obtaining their results that determined their resource contributions! As a special bonus, they got to eat their sweet sample!

Her and our lab have several overlapping projects, espcially those seeking to understand fish movement across seascapes. Thus, we have deemed each other \"sister labs,\" and are very proud to have such strong ties with an incredible lab. Dr. Rehage is a coastal ecologist, with expertise on fish ecology, recreational fisheries, and disturbance ecology. Her research program broadly focuses on how fish and fisheries respond to hydroclimatic variation and extreme disturbances and on the implications of these responses for their sustainability and to pressing water resources and climate challenges.\n  \n  Over the past decade at FIU, Jenn's lab has been focusing on Everglades fisheries and in better understanding how fish track hydroclimatic variation across coastal seascapes to inform how fish and the fisheries they support will respond to the tension of climate change and ongoing restoration efforts. We consider ourselves extremely lucky to work in the Everglades! Like other subtropical ecosystems, the ecology of the Everglades is governed by a pulsed disturbance regime, and the system has been subject to intense hydrological modification, allowing us to examine how fish communities respond to the interaction of natural and anthropogenic disturbances and the implications of this for the ability of coastal areas to provide key ecosystem services such as recreational fisheries. Ongoing research efforts aim to understand how fishes move through their seascapes, what drives these movement, how those movements fit into large-scale ecosystem processes and what are the consequences for socio-economically valuable recreational fisheries. Her lab's research mainly focus on key recreational species such as: Tarpon, Snook, Bonefish, Florida Bass, Jack Crevalle, and Redfish.\n  \n  Our research approach to studying fish and fisheries is holistic and integrative. We consider recreational fisheries as inherently a coupled socioecological system, and thus blend in our research human and ecological dimensions in our studies. For instance, recent studies involve angler knowledge as a way to better understand data-limited species and have made strides to make these type of data quantitative and integrated into other types of data. We like to look at coastal fisheries problems through an individual lens, that focuses on the behavior of either fish or anglers and then we scale up inquiry from individual behavior to populations and communities, and ecosystem function and the provisioning of services. Our approach to tackling fish research focuses on both understanding process and pattern, and we thrive in conducting studies that blend these to inform management, conservation and restoration efforts. As others, we like for our research to be meaningful to society and help solve problems, and thus increasingly we find ourselves partnering with government, nongovernment and stakeholders (e.g., fishing guides associations) to coproduce research that addresses pressing societal needs and challenges and bring forth the relevance of fish and fisheries to these challenges. We are strong believers in team science and public engagement, and often collaborate with social and physical scientists, as well as with stakeholders to stretch the bounds and dimensionality of our questioning and make our findings accessible and actionable for stakeholders. We find that asking questions that cross multiple scales of ecological organization, integrate human and natural dimensions, and involve collaborative, transdisciplinary, and translational approaches resonate with who we are and maximizes our understanding in meaningful ways.\n  We aim for our research to contribute to our understanding of the ecology of these fisheries, and particularly of the freshwater flows-fisheries relationships that underpin fisheries production in our coasts, and importantly, of their sustainability in the face of both natural and anthropogenic disturbances. For instance, ongoing work takes a spatial approach that involves tracking of the movement and space use of valuable recreational fisheries across coastal seascapes that have suffered varying degrees of transformation due to human impacts (e.g., chronic decreases in freshwater inputs, hypersalinity and seagrass die-off), while informing federal and state water management practices, and partnering with fishing guides to derive hypotheses about fishery responses based on angler knowledge."

    "text": "Florida Keys\n    \n\n\n\nFish In Seagrass Habitats: Seascape Connectivity Across Protected Ecosystems: FISHSCAPE\n  \n  Overview:\n  Marine protected areas often aim for habitat representation to fulfil the needs of species that forage widely, such as from reefs into seagrass beds. In the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, Sanctuary Preservation Areas (SPAs) contain only a small area of seagrass, but if this was expanded, there is little data on how much seagrass is required to support foraging reef fishes. This project will collect field and laboratory data to provide clear guidance to managers on these seagrass requirements. Project components will include data on seascape characteristics and their potential to change because of environmental stressors, invertebrate and fish prey abundances, risk of predation, fish foraging patterns (using acoustic telemetry), fish physiology, and stable isotopes. These data will be integrated into bioenergetic models that will allow us to estimate the seagrass area needed within a SPA to support foraging reef fishes under current and future habitat states and consequently aid management decisions.\n  Keep up to date with this project by following the project Instagram! @fiu_fishscape\n  \n\n\n  Our Role: Seascape Characterization (Spearheaded by Marianna Coppola)\n  \n  \n  Accurate habitat maps underpin the FISHSCAPE project, as seascape configuration drives key ecological processes such as fish foraging patterns and prey abundance. The Seascape Ecology lab has been contributing to the project creating accurate benthic habitat maps through a remote sensing approach. These maps are crucial to delineate seagrass patches and quantify seascape characteristics across the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. To address ecological problems at multiple spatiotemporal scales, we aim to integrate in situ data with multispectral images acquired by unmanned aerial vehicles (i.e. drones) and medium- to coarse-resolution satellites. This proposed multi-scale mapping approach will enable us to quantify the relationships between organisms and their habitats by assessing functional connectivity. It will do so by identifying seagrass habitat characteristics surrounding reefs across various seascape scales commonly used by foraging fishes within the FKNMS.\n  \n\n\n\n\n  Our Role: Ecosystem Function (Spearheaded by Gina Badlowski)\n  Ecosystem functions can vary depending on habitat structure (e.g., species composition, canopy height, size, and location). Recent studies have shown that even when habitat structures appear similar, they do not always result in similar ecosystem functions, such as supporting food webs. While monitoring and management actions often focus on the structural aspects of habitats, we propose adopting management strategies incorporating a more comprehensive understanding of ecosystem functions. To accomplish this, we suggest using E-scape maps [spatially explicit production maps, identifying areas where food resources are abundant or scarce by calculating a Habitat Resource Index (HRI)], which correlate seagrass habitat structure with food web dynamics and energy flow. These E-scapes integrate seagrass seascape characterization (see above), prey availability (led by the Campbell Lab), and food web models derived from stable isotope analysis. We collect basal resources (e.g., seagrass, macroalgae), lower trophic level prey species (e.g., gastropods, small fishes), and fin clip samples from acoustically tagged focal fish. These samples are analyzed for carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur stable isotopes to determine the contribution of seagrass meadow and reef-derived food sources to different trophic levels.\n  \n\n\n\n    \n    This project is funded by the following sponsors:"

    "text": "Puerto Rico Seascapes\n    \n\n\n\nEvaluating Herbivore Impact and Restoration Strategies for Coral Reef Resilience in the Caribbean\n  \n    This project consists of two separate grants, together culumating in broadly understanding coral reef resilience and restoration potential in Culebra, Puerto Rico. Please read on to understand both of these projects and their scope!\n    \n    \n  NFWF Overview: (Spearheaded by Nico Rivas)\n  This project is dedicated to restoring the structural integrity and ecological health of coral reefs in Puerto Rico that have been damaged by hurricanes. By rehabilitating the three-dimensional framework of these reefs, we aim to enhance their resilience, allowing them to better withstand future natural disasters and environmental changes. Coral reefs are vital ecosystems that provide shelter, food, and breeding grounds for countless marine species. Restoring their structure is key to ensuring the long-term biodiversity and functionality of these critical habitats. \n  Goals and Objectives:\n  Our primary goal is to rebuild the three-dimensional structure of the reefs to restore their ecological function and support the rich biodiversity they harbor. In doing so, we aim to strengthen their resilience against future hurricanes and the effects of climate change. Additionally, our project seeks to improve the overall health of these reef ecosystems,  supporting both marine life and the communities that rely on them. \n  Methods:\n  Our restoration efforts involve a combination of coral propagation, outplanting, and cutting-edge techniques such as 3D printing and photogrammetry to reconstruct and assess the reefs’ structural integrity. These techniques enable us to accurately restore the physical complexity of the reefs, which is essential for promoting healthy coral growth and providing shelter for marine life. We are also implementing a comprehensive monitoring plan to track the progress and effectiveness of our restoration activities. Collaboration with local communities, researchers at the Sociedad Ambiente Marino, and stakeholders is central to our approach, ensuring that the project not only benefits the environment but also aligns with the needs and goals of Puerto Rico’s coastal communities.\n  \n  This project represents a critical step in the long-term preservation and restoration of Puerto Rico’s coral reefs, ensuring that these ecosystems continue to thrive for future generations.\n  \n\n\n\n        \n        Your browser does not support the video tag.\n    \n\n\n\n  RAPID Overview: (Spearheaded by Nico Rivas)\n  Coral reef benthic community assemblage and functioning are controlled in part by herbivores that graze on algae, which compete for space with various taxa, including scleractinian coral and sponge species. In the Caribbean, it is hypothesized that the black sea urchin, Diadema antillarum, is a keystone grazer that controls macroalgae species composition and biomass at low levels and facilitates the recruitment and survival of reef-building corals, leading to a coral-dominated state of reefs. The recent D. antillarum die-off provides the conditions of a natural removal experiment useful to understand the top-down control exertion of this herbivore, especially by quantifying the spatial arrangement progression of benthic functional groups across urchin abundances.\n  This project leverages the existing NFWF grant and gave additional funding to take advantage of the 2021 D. antillarum die off in Puerto Rico to monitoring population dynamics of D. antillarum and the top down effects this has on macroalgae density within the predefined plots of interest at our study sites.\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n  Understanding stony coral community stability over time in the Northeast Marine Corridor\n  Puerto Rico SeaGrant Overview: (Spearheaded by Valentina Bautista)\n  \n  Goals and Objectives:\n  The Northeast Marine Corridor (NEMC) encompasses a diverse seascape made up of coral reefs, seagrass beds, nesting beaches, and mangroves forest that support ecosystem functions such as coastal protection, fisheries, and tourism. Local managers with the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources have identified eleven Areas of Special Interest (ASIs) for coral reef conservation within the NEMC, yet we lack critical data on community traits and demographic performance that are essential for understanding implications to ecological resilience and function.\n  This project aims to enhance coral reef conservation efforts by developing a new ecosystem-based management (EBM) tool for Puerto Rico’s Strategic Management Plan for Coral Reefs in the Northeast Marine Corridor. Current conservation methods rely on simplistic metrics like coral cover, which fail to capture the complex dynamics of reef ecosystems. This project uses a trait-based hypervolume approach to quantify coral community structure and resilience, incorporating ecological traits and demographic data to better predict coral responses to environmental stressors. By improving the accuracy of conservation planning tools, this approach will guide more effective strategies for protecting coral reefs.\n  Methods:\n  We will employ advanced digital photogrammetry to create high-resolution (&lt;1 cm) orthorectified photomosaics of coral reefs at key Areas of Special Interest (ASIs) within the Northeast Marine Corridor to quantify Benthic community composition. Environmental conditions, alongside community trait data, will be integrated into the hypervolume analysis to assess coral demographic performance.\n\n\n\n        \n        Your browser does not support the video tag.\n    \n\n  \n    These projects are funded by the following sponsors:"

In the Caribbean, climate change induced droughts are predicted to increase in frequency and severity, and the need for accurate estimates of organism response is needed. Thus, in order to analyze how organisms respond to drought conditions in Caribbean tropical forests, the effect of drought on movement of freshwater shrimp in two adjacent headwater streams was measured using stream discharge, pool size, and shrimp density via a mark recapture methodology.\n  This experiment took place in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF), part of El Yunque National Forest in northeastern Puerto Rico. This area is also a part of the Luquillo Long Term Ecological Research program (LUQ-LTER). The LEF is one of the most intensely studied neotropical ecosystems, with ecological research beginning here in the 1940s. At 350 meters above sea level, annual precipitation is about 3500mm. While there is slightly less rainfall from January to April, the LEF is considered an aseasonal rainforest as all months receive approximately 100mm of precipitation. In this study, water in one stream, consisting of many step-pools, was diverted around the pools to model future drought conditions. Freshwater shrimp were chosen as the study organism given their role in the aquatic ecosystem, they dominate the food web in Puerto Rican headwater streams. These shrimps provide ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling, and algae control, and connect coastal and montane ecosystems through their amphidromous lifecycles. The three genera of shrimp present in headwater streams in the LEF are Macrobrachium, Atya, and Xiphocaris.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Research Objectives:\n  While research has focused on the effects of disturbance on the abundance and density of shrimp, the direct drivers that cue individual shrimp movement between habitat patches remain uncertain. To fully understand the impacts of drought on shrimp communities in tropical headwater streams, this proposed project will test various tagging technologies and select the most appropriate methodology to track Atya and Xiphocaris shrimp; and use mark-recapture and environmental data to elucidate the drivers of shrimp movement. By investigating the effects of drought on aquatic animal movement, we will better understand the consequences of climate change that affect both the extreme high and low flows.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Methods:\n  The Stream Flow Reduction Experiment (StreamFRE) was conducted in two tributaries of the Espiritu Santo River in Puerto Rico, referred to as the Control Stream and the Experimental Stream. In the Experimental Stream, 50% of water flow was diverted over a 150 m stretch during the dry season from February to July in 2022 and 2023. A capture, mark, and recapture (CMR) study was performed in both streams to track shrimp movement, with shrimp in specific pools marked using visible implant tags. These pools, linked by shallow riffles, were chosen for their ability to retain water during droughts. Shrimp traps were baited and set overnight, and recapture surveys were conducted monthly. Over the course of the study, 1,190 shrimp were tagged, allowing researchers to monitor shrimp movements, particularly during the experimental flow reduction period. Data from collaborators also contributed to tracking the shrimp throughout the area.\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n  This project is funded by the following sponsors:"

She grew up in Northern Indiana, spending every day of the summer on the lake catching turtles, ID'ing seaweeds, and also wakeboarding and surfing. She went on to Indiana University for her BS in environmental science, and became heavily involved in the Center for Underwater Science. There she spent a year after graduating as a visiting lecturer and research associate, where she taught the open water scuba classes and assisted with research looking at coral recruitment on shipwreck sites. She is focusing her thesis on understanding how environmental gradients impact coral community niche space, facilitating inter and intraspecific variation in species. Specifically, she is focused on how select physiological traits converge to create a spectral signature. She hopes to use hyperspectral imaging to detect changes in spectra intensity and relate that back to individual traits, creating a new, noninvasive measure of coral health. \n              email: hlamle@fiu.edu\n          \n      \n      \n          \n      \n  \n\n  \n      \n      \n          \n              Valentina Bautista\n              MS Student\n              Valentina is an ecologist from Colombia, holding dual degrees in Environmental Studies (B.S.) and Sustainability (B.A.) from Florida International University.

    "text": "Coastal Fish Ecology and Fisheries Lab\n  Other Projects in our lab pair closely with Dr. Jennifer Rehage's Lab, located within the FIU institute of Environment Earth and Environment department. Since our work with seascape ecology aligns closely with movement ecology, we collaborate heavily together and have deemed each other \"sister labs.\"\n  The Rehage Lab consists of coastal ecologists, passionate about fish and fisheries and the issues that affect them, particularly water and climate issues and their interacting effects. We focus on understanding how water and water management decisions interact with climate patterns to affect fish and the quality of recreational fisheries. Our research takes a holistic approach to studying fish, integrating from the behavior of individuals to populations and entire fish communities and their effects and responses to ecosystem processes, their interactions and responses to both natural and human disturbances, and extending to the human dimensions of fish- involving anglers in science and understanding their knowledge and perceptions. Ongoing research efforts aim to understand how fishes move through their seascapes, what drives these movement, how those movements fit into large-scale ecosystem processes and what are the consequences for socio-economically valuable recreational fisheries. Our research mainly takes places in the Everglades and coastal South Florida, and we focus on key recreational species such as: Tarpon, Snook, Bonefish, Florida Bass, Jack Crevalle, and Redfish.
