Following graduation, I attended the University of Alabama at Birmingham for my MS, and in 2020, I completed my PhD at the University of Louisiana Lafayette. My research interests include understanding the drivers of consumer distribution, movement, and resource use, the role of habitat configuration and composition on ecosystem processes, and the recovery of ecosystem function following restoration and disturbance. Currently at FIU, my research focuses on the impacts of altered freshwater inflows in Florida Bay, and its consequences for seagrass ecosystems.\n              email: wjames@fiu.edu\n          \n      \n      \n          \n      \n  \n\n\n  \n      \n      \n          \n              Dr. Jonathan Rodemann\n              Postdoctoral Scholar\n              Growing up in New Jersey, I developed a love for ocean creatures from a young age. After high school, my interest in marine life brought me to south Florida, where I obtained a B.S. in Marine Science and Biology from the University of Miami. I attended a non-thesis based Master’s program at Northeastern University called the Three Seas Program, where I spent time in Boston, Panama, and Washington state learning about the marine ecosystems of these regions. This program ended with an internship with the Smithsonian’s Tennenbaum Marine Observatories Network looking at the variation in marine consumption pressure along a latitudinal gradient. I was then drawn back down to south Florida, where I started a PhD at FIU in the Coastal Fisheries Lab. I am interested in how biotic and abiotic factors affect fish movement and behavior. During my time at FIU, I am focusing on how habitat transformation caused by a seagrass die-off in Florida Bay has affected the movement and trophic ecology of recreational sportfish.\n              email: jrodeman@fiu.edu\n          \n      \n      \n          \n      \n  \n\n  \n      \n      \n          \n              Nico Rivas\n              Phd Candidate\n              I was born in Santiago, Chile and moved to Florida when I was five years old. My family and I went to the beach almost every weekend which sparked my interest in marine life. I attended the University of Central Florida in Orlando to pursue a degree in Biology with a focus in pre-med. Halfway through I joined a lab to gain research experience and decided to switch my focus from pre-med to marine biology. Since then, I earned my B.S. in Biology from UCF and later earned my M.S. in Marine Biology and Ecology from the University of Miami RSMAS. I am now pursuing my Ph.D. here at FIU where I will be researching fish population dynamics in relation to coral restoration. I am studying fish population dynamics in response to coral reef restoration efforts in Culebra, Puerto Rico. We are interested in testing the efficacy of 3D printed corals to restore fish populations as compared to live coral. We are using BRUVS and photogrammetry techniques to track fish populations, coral distribution and recruitment.\n              email: nirivas@fiu.edu\n          \n      \n      \n          \n      \n  \n\n  \n      \n      \n          \n              Gina Badlowski\n              Phd Student\n              My interests and research revolve around seascape ecology, specifically the influence of spatial structure and habitat heterogeneity on the patterns of species interactions, distributions, and movements within marine communities.\n              email: gbadlows@fiu.edu\n          \n      \n      \n          \n      \n  \n\n  \n      \n      \n          \n              Marianna Coppola\n              PhD Student\n              Marianna is a seascape ecologist with a focus on seagrass dynamics.

She grew up in Northern Indiana, spending every day of the summer on the lake catching turtles, ID'ing seaweeds, and also wakeboarding and surfing. She went on to Indiana University for her BS in environmental science, and became heavily involved in the Center for Underwater Science. There she spent a year after graduating as a visiting lecturer and research associate, where she taught the open water scuba classes and assisted with research looking at coral recruitment on shipwreck sites. She is focusing her thesis on understanding how environmental gradients impact coral community niche space, facilitating inter and intraspecific variation in species. Specifically, she is focused on how select physiological traits converge to create a spectral signature. She hopes to use hyperspectral imaging to detect changes in spectra intensity and relate that back to individual traits, creating a new, noninvasive measure of coral health. \n              email: hlamle@fiu.edu\n          \n      \n      \n          \n      \n  \n\n  \n      \n      \n          \n              Valentina Bautista\n              MS Student\n              Valentina was born and grew up in the mountains of Colombia, but came to Miami when she was 10. She subsequently found her passion for the environment through working for our sister lab, the Rehage Coastal Fisheries Science lab, but took an opportunity to study coral community functional trait space with Dr. Santos when he acquired his own lab.

This can be as large as creating a habitat suitability model for seagrass restoration in Biscyane Bay using remote sensing techniques, to assessing fish movement across habitats in the Florida Keys, to assessing micro-suitability plots for coral settlement. While our projects sound very different, they all are rooted in the foundations of landscape ecology and furthering our understanding of the habitat connectivity of various marine and aquatic environments. We are passionate about understanding these drivers to further aid us in creating resilient ecosystems in the face of Climate Change.\n  \n\n\n\n    \n        Our lab values collaboration and the use of transdisciplinary science to holistically analyze ecosystem dynamics. We are proud to partner with many different government and nonprofit agencies in South Florida as well as Puerto Rico."
