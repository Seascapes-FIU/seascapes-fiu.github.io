      <div class="news-title"><i>The Coral Team presents at the 2024 Reef Futures Conference</i></div>
  </div>
  <p>Coral team members Nico Rivas, Valentina Bautista, and Hannah-Marie Lamle presented on their graduate studies at the <a href="https://www.reeffutures.com/">Reef Futures Conference</a>, accompanied by Dr. Santos. Nico had a 5 minute lightning talk presentation, while Valentina and Hannah-Marie got to discuss their research in the poster session. This conference was a great experience for our team to discuss our research to a wider audience of managers and restoration practitioners. The team spent down time networking and catching up with old friends, as well as make new ones. This conference provided hope and encouragement for us working in the often difficult field of coral restoration.</p>
  <p>Funding for this conference was acquired by the Puerto Rico SeaGrant program, <a href="https://crestcache.fiu.edu/index.html">FIU CREST Center for Aquatic Chemistry and Environment</a>, and the <a href="https://dasa.fiu.edu/all-departments/student-government-association/committees/graduate-professional-student-committee/">FIU Graduate & Professional Student Committee</a>. We are very grateful for the awards provided from these organizations to be able to travel and attend the conference. </p>
  <p>- Nico Rivas: <b>"Will weedy coral species take over Caribbean reefs? Population dynamics of <i>Porites astreoides</i> under different environmental conditions</b></p>
  <p>- Valentina Bautista: <b>"Assessing Functional Trait Dynamics of Caribbean Scleractinia Communities in Puerto Rico's Northeast Marine Corridor"</b>
  <p>- Hannah-Marie Lamle: <b>"Show me your colors: Using spectroscopy to quantify coral health"</b></p>

  </div>
  <p>Team Seascape took over team FISHSCAPE for an outreach event at Citrus Grove K-8 two weeks ago! Lab members Hannah-Marie, Gina, and Nico spent a night teaching k-8 students and parents about some of the science the lab (and collaborators) do for an ongoing project down in the Florida Keys: <b>Fish In Seagrass Habitats: Seascape Connectivity Across Protected Areas</b></p>
  <p>Students had a blast learning how to measure a Great Barracuda, one of the main study species! Students also got to learn about stable isotopes: how to process samples using sweet tarts and fruit roll ups, drop their sample into an analyzer, and finally obtaining their results that determined their resource contributions! As a special bonus, they got to eat their sweet sample! What a blast it was to do educational outreach and we look forward to future events to share our science with others!</p>
