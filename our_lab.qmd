              <h2>Dr. Jonathan Rodemann</h2>
              <h4><em>Postdoctoral Scholar</em></h4>
              <p>Jon is a seascape and movement ecologist focusing on the impacts of disturbances on multi-scale processes such as recovery and habitat selection. He obtained his B.S. in Marine Science and Biology from the University of Miami, and subsequently attended a non-thesis based Master’s program at Northeastern University called the Three Seas Program, spending time in Boston, Panama, and Washington state learning about the marine ecosystems of the regions. This program ended with an internship with the Smithsonian’s Tennenbaum Marine Observatories Network looking at the variation in marine consumption pressure along a latitudinal gradient. He then transitioned back down to south Florida, to complete his Ph.D. at FIU in the <a href="https://myweb.fiu.edu/rehagej/">Coastal Fisheries Lab.</a> Currently, his research uses multiple approaches such as remote sensing, acoustic telemetry, and causal modelling to understand the impacts of press (lack of freshwater inflow) and pulse (seagrass die-off and hurricanes) disturbances on the Florida Bay ecosystem. Whether it is investigating the sources of nutrients driving persistent algal blooms or mapping seagrass with satellites to determine preferred habitat of Spotted Seatrout, the goal of Jon’s research is to inform Everglades conservation, management, and restoration.</p>

              <h2>Marianna Coppola</h2>
              <h4><em>Ph.D. Candidate</em></h4>
              <p>Marianna is an international PhD candidate from Italy interested in elucidating seagrass habitat structure and dynamics in Biscayne Bay and the Florida Keys. She started her doctoral degree in the Santos’ Seascape Ecology lab in 2022 when she was awarded a Fulbright scholarship. Marianna earned a master’s degree in marine biology and ecology from the <a href="https://www.international.unina.it/">University of Naples Federico II, Italy,</a> where she applied GIS in the framework of algal bed restoration and maritime spatial planning in the Mediterranean Sea. Marianna's research at FIU focuses on seagrass seascapes from a spatially explicit perspective. She is currently working on two projects funded by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that aim to understand the impacts of water quality on seagrass seascape structure, dynamics and stability in Biscayne Bay, and to inform the protection of seagrass meadows in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary to support commercially important fish species through collaborative research. Marianna applies remote sensing principles to map coastal habitats and quantify seascape structural characteristics at different spatiotemporal scales using a variety of multispectral image data from satellite and drone sensors. Marianna’s work requires in situ ground truthing data, and she has been leading the fieldwork necessary for her project involving undergraduate and graduate FIU students, yachters, and non-profit organizations. Marianna is a member of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/asprs.fiu.chapter">American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) FIU Student Chapter</a>, which aims to support the community of students applying remote sensing at FIU and connect with other Student Chapters. When Marianna is not at work, she is probably wearing her snorkeling mask and exploring a new reef, or enjoying some good live music!</p>

              <h4><em>Ph.D. Candidate</em></h4>
              <p>Hannah-Marie spent the first two decades of her life in Northern Indiana, spending every day of the summer on the lake catching turtles, ID'ing seaweeds, and also wakeboarding and surfing, where she developed a love for water. She went on to Indiana University for her B.S. in environmental science, and became heavily involved in the <a href="https://underwaterscience.indiana.edu/index.html">Center for Underwater Science.</a> There she specialized in monitoring coral recruitment on shipwreck sites in the Dominican Republic. She spent a year after graduating as a visiting lecturer and research associate, where she taught the open water scuba classes and assisted with monitoring of the critically endangered pillar coral, <i>Dendrogyra cylindrus</i>. She has transitioned to FIU for a Ph.D. in biology and is focusing her dissertation on understanding how environmental gradients alter variation in the coral community trait space. Specifically, she is focused on how select physiological traits converge to create a spectral signature. She hopes to use hyperspectral imaging to detect changes in spectra intensity and relate that back to individual traits, creating a new, noninvasive measure of coral health. </p>
