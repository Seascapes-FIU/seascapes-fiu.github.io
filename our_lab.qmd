              <h2>Dr. Jonathan Rodemann</h2>
              <h4><em>Postdoctoral Scholar</em></h4>
              <p>Jon is a seascape and movement ecologist focusing on the impacts of disturbances on multi-scale processes such as recovery and habitat selection. Currently, his research uses multiple approaches such as remote sensing, acoustic telemetry, and causal modelling to understand the impacts of press (lack of freshwater inflow) and pulse (seagrass die-off and hurricanes) on the Florida Bay ecosystem. Whether it is investigating the sources of nutrients driving persistent algal blooms or mapping seagrass with satellites to determine preferred habitat of Spotted Seatrout, the goal of Jon’s research is to inform Everglades conservation, management, and restoration.</p>

              <h4><em>Phd Candidate</em></h4>
              <p>Nico is an ecologist from Chile with an M.S. in Marine Biology and Ecology, currently working on his doctorate’s degree in the Santos Seascape Ecology Lab. Nico completed his undergraduate degree at the University of Central Florida where he graduated with a bachelor’s degree in biology. He then completed a master’s degree at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science with a concentration in coral restoration. His M.S. focused on protecting coral outplants from corallivorous fish. Now, he works on reefs in Culebra, Puerto Rico and is involved in restoration and monitoring projects that use novel techniques like 3D printing and photogrammetry to assess coral reef states.</p>

              <h4><em>PhD Student</em></h4>
              <p>Hannah-Marie spent the first two decades of her life in Indiana. She grew up in Northern Indiana, spending every day of the summer on the lake catching turtles, ID'ing seaweeds, and also wakeboarding and surfing. She went on to Indiana University for her BS in environmental science, and became heavily involved in the Center for Underwater Science. There she spent a year after graduating as a visiting lecturer and research associate, where she taught the open water scuba classes and assisted with research looking at coral recruitment on shipwreck sites. She is focusing her thesis on understanding how environmental gradients impact coral community niche space, facilitating inter and intraspecific variation in species. Specifically, she is focused on how select physiological traits converge to create a spectral signature. She hopes to use hyperspectral imaging to detect changes in spectra intensity and relate that back to individual traits, creating a new, noninvasive measure of coral health. </p>

              <p>Valentina is an ecologist from Colombia, holding dual degrees in Environmental Studies (B.S.) and Sustainability (B.A.) from Florida International University. During her undergraduate studies, she gained valuable experience as an intern and later as a research technician in our sister lab, the <a href="https://myweb.fiu.edu/rehagej/">Rehage Lab,</a> where she contributed to projects focused on coastal Everglades ecology. In 2022, Valentina joined the Santos Lab to pursue a master's in biology, with a research focus on applying functional ecology to quantify changes in Puerto Rican marine benthic communities and their implications for ecosystem function. As a graduate student, Valentina actively participates in scientific diving operations, aiding critical research across South Florida and Puerto Rico.</p>

              <p>Victoria currently serves as lab manager for both the Santos Seascape Ecology Lab and our sister lab, the <a href="https://myweb.fiu.edu/rehagej/">Rehage Coastal Fisheries Lab.</a></p>
              <p>Victoria is a Florida native who received her bachelor’s degree in marine biology from New College of Florida, where she developed a passion for acoustic telemetry through her undergraduate honors thesis research on blacktip shark migration patterns over time and their relationship with climate change. In addition to being a certified divemaster, she has a background in animal husbandry and science communications & outreach. Over time, she has worked in the Everglades, Biscayne National Park, the Florida Keys, Florida Bay, the Tampa Bay area, and Culebra, Puerto Rico, and her favorite animal she’s had the opportunity to work with is a smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata). In addition to supporting the labs in all their day-to-day operations, she has been involved in nearly every project our labs have to offer. Overall, she loves the new experiences and learning opportunities she has been exposed to as the result of her work, and strives to never stop developing new skills. In the future, she plans to pursue a Master’s degree and continue working with movement ecology.</p>

              <h4><em>Lab Technician</em></h4>
              <p>Christine is a biologist from Venezuela, with an MPS in Fisheries Management and Conservation, currently serving as the Santos Lab technician. Before moving to Miami to pursue her MPS at the University of Miami, she lived in Colombia. During her studies, she completed her MPS internship report with the Santos Lab and continued working there after graduating. Christine is dedicated to supporting the team and assisting students with their research projects. She has been involved in conservation efforts in Culebra, Puerto Rico, where she analyzes BRUVs data to study reef fish abundance and participates in fieldwork for BRUV setup and deployment. She is currently using BRUVs data to study the abundance of target snapper and grouper species across different habitat complexities. Christine also assists with calibrating coral reef photomosaics using Viscore and outlining the reef’s macroalgal cover. In the lab, she helps process stable isotopes from various samples, including seagrass, algae, invertebrates, and fish, for food web ecology. </p>
