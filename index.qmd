        <h1>Welcome to Our Lab</h1>
        <p>We are a multidisciplinary lab within the <a href="https://environment.fiu.edu/">Institute of Environment</a> broadly interested in studying the interactions and relationships between different components of marine and aquatic environments, particularly relating to spatial patterning and temporal dynamics.</p>

<div class="centered-text"
  <p>Each member in our lab is driven by understanding spatial patterning of aquatic and marine environments, our unofficial slogan is "from the streams to the seas." Our team is specialized in applying traditional ecological theory to explain where organisms are distributed in the environment. This can be as large as creating a habitat suitability model for seagrass restoration in Biscyane Bay using remote sensing techniques, to assessing fish movement across habitats in the Florida Keys, to assessing micro-suitability plots for coral settlement. While our projects sound very different, they all are rooted in the foundations of landscape ecology and furthering our understanding of the habitat connectivity of various marine and aquatic environments. We are passionate about understanding these drivers to further aid us in creating resilient ecosystems in the face of Climate Change.</p>

        <p>Our lab values collaboration and the use of transdisciplinary science to holistically analyze ecosystem dynamics. We are proud to partner with many different government and nonprofit agencies in South Florida as well as Puerto Rico.</p>
